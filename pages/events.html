    <h1>April 22nd - Community Cleanup</h1>
    <p>
        The new Westwood Neighbors Association is looking for volunteers to help improve our community. If you’re interested in volunteering
        time or resources to assist us in cleaning up the common areas within the neighborhood, please let us know.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of our residents aren’t even aware that there is a large park complete with playground equipment and large open field,
        right here in our neighborhood. Currently, these features are in a state of disrepair, grown over with weeds and
        trash. Many of us would like to see this area become usable again, so that our children can enjoy the benefits of
        a safe, clean park so close to our homes. If you are one of the many who would like to see this dream become a reality,
        please join us on Saturday, April 22nd at 1:30 PM for the creation of a planning committee to address the cleanup
        of the park and other common areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will be the first of many such meetings aimed at improving our community, increasing house values, and providing a safe
        neighborhood for our children to call home. To participate, please attend this meeting at the community park whose
        entrance is located on 7th St, between Davis and Markwell. Thank you for your interest in making our neighborhood
        a better place, and we look forward to seeing you, soon.
    </p>
