        The Westwood Neighbors Association is not a homeownerâ€™s association. We are a not-for-profit organization aimed at making
        our neighborhood a better place to call home. Community areas are owned, but not maintained, by the homeowners of
        the neighborhood, and the Westwood Neighbors Association has been given authority to do what needs to be done to
        improve our community. Membership in the Westwood Neighbors Association is voluntary, and is not required for access
        to the common areas. If you would like to become an organizing member of the Westwood Neighbors Association, please
        email
        <a href="mailto:admin@westwoodna.com">admin@westwoodna.com</a> and let us know. If you would like to volunteer for
        the Community Clean Up Organizing Event, please join us on Saturday April 22nd at the community park whose entrance
        is located on 7th St, between Davis and Markwell.
